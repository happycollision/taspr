# taspr Environment Configuration
#
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed.
# Bun automatically loads .env files - no dotenv required.

# =============================================================================
# GitHub Integration Tests
# =============================================================================
# These variables configure the test repository used for GitHub integration
# tests (PR creation, branch protection, CI status checks, etc.)
#
# Run `bun run test:github:setup` to create/reset the test repository.
# Run `bun run test:github` to run integration tests.

# Repository name for integration tests (default: taspr-check)
# TASPR_TEST_REPO_NAME=taspr-check

# Repository owner (default: your authenticated GitHub username via `gh api user`)
# Use this to point tests at an org-owned repo or another user's fork.
# TASPR_TEST_REPO_OWNER=your-username

# The following settings are not recommended to be set in a .env, but rather set
# directly preceding your call to the test script. They are included here for
# reference.

# Skip confirmation prompts in setup script (set to "1" for CI environments)
# Without this, the setup script will prompt before:
#   - Creating a new repository
#   - Force pushing to a repo missing the safety marker
# TASPR_TEST_REPO_SETUP_SKIP_CONFIRM=1

# Enable GitHub integration tests (set to "1" to run them)
# These tests are slow (real API calls) and require `gh auth login`.
# GITHUB_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1
